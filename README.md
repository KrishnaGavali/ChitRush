## 📜 Game Rules

1. **🟢 Wait for Everyone to Be Ready**  
   Game only starts when **all players hit "Ready"**. Don’t jump the gun. Respect the lobby vibes 🙏

2. **🗑️ Got 4 Chits? Toss One!**  
   You’ll get **4 random chits**. Now drag & drop **1 unwanted chit** into the drop zone. Simple? Sure. Strategic? Oh yeah.

3. **🎉 4 of a Kind = You Win**  
   If you’re lucky (or clever?) enough to get all **4 chits of the same type**, congratulations—**you win the round!** Brag responsibly 😎
